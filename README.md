# iHaveIt

## Description 
`iHaveIt` is my project for the WTMB JavaScript Crash Course! :) 

Have you ever bought or gotten something that you already had? Perhaps more than once? 
Yes! I have too! For this reason, iHaveIt was created! 

iHaveIt :heavy_check_mark: helps us track items like groceries, books, movies, etc. that we are not sure if we have
already and that we may end up buying or getting again (sometimes multiple times!).
